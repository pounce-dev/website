<h1>Welcome to BYUi OSDevelopment</h1>
    <p>Are you new to development and eager to learn? Join us as we dive into the world of assembly, GitHub, and other essential development skills. Our dedicated community strives to build from the ground up, starting with our very own basic kernel project, affectionately named the Kitty Kernel. Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your knowledge, we're here to support and guide you on your development journey.</p>

    <p>All of our repositories can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pounce-dev/repositories">Pounce-dev GitHub page</a>. Contributions are Welcome!</p>
